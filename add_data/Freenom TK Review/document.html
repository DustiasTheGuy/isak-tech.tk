    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Freenom is a website where anyone can grab a free domain name. A domain name is what's used when visiting a
        website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: https://<mark>facebook.com</mark>
    </p>
    <p>
        Or https://<mark>isak-tech.tk</mark>
    </p>
    <p>
        Most domains cost some amount of money to obtain but with Freenom you can get one without cost.
        So why not right? 
    </p>

    <h3>Why are .tk domains free?</h3>
    <p>
        .tk is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand in the South Pacific. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.tk">Source - Wikipedia</a>
    </p>
    <p>Since the demand for .tk domains is so low you can get most of them for free.</p>
