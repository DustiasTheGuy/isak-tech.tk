        My experience with Linode as of today has been nothing but pleasant.
        The user interface is easy to use and there are plenty of guides and tutorials on the web that can guide you on
        how to set up your own linode.

        Iâ€™ve had one interaction with the email-support and they were very polite and understanding, They providing me with
        useful information and tools to solve my problems.
